WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. • WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. • The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized • Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.

In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page numbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset automatically) . I have implemented this option in this report. • Language Translation was used for this report in German and French • I did not use IBM templates for this report. I have customized our own template in this report.  BTRAMR0009.rptdesign (Availability Report):  • This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a Availability Graph based on selected Train Assets, a timeframe and selected work types / work order parameters. • Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train. The business requirement is to be able to select this base as needed to suit the project or view needed at that time.  BTRAMR0027.rptdesign (Card Stock Report): Existing report functionality: • Technician requiring a part will take the component in its bin along with an Inventory Card. The technician reports the consumption at the exit of the storeroom on the Kiosk computer where    he scans its Work Order and the Inventory Card in the application Issue and Transfer of Maximo. When we rebuild something internally, the technician will bring the new assembly in store, grab the Inventory Card and he will report the return in store against the rebuilt Work order. Objectives: • Created a card stock report in order to match the existing Inventory Card tool developed by Systems. • Increase reporting of consumption • Redefine the process of cycle count (80% efficiency in Systems) • The report will be based on inventory information and will introduce the notion of real time to increase precision  BTRAMR0001SBB.rptdesign (Report Change): • The report BTRAMR0001SBB was developed for the European project. It is based on the BTRAMR0001MLM report and currently uses only launch option 2 and 3 of the BTRAMR0001MLM report.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. • WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. • The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized • Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.

In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page numbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset automatically) . I have implemented this option in this report. • Language Translation was used for this report in German and French • I did not use IBM templates for this report. I have customized our own template in this report.  BTRAMR0009.rptdesign (Availability Report):  • This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a Availability Graph based on selected Train Assets, a timeframe and selected work types / work order parameters. • Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train. The business requirement is to be able to select this base as needed to suit the project or view needed at that time.  BTRAMR0027.rptdesign (Card Stock Report): Existing report functionality: • Technician requiring a part will take the component in its bin along with an Inventory Card. The technician reports the consumption at the exit of the storeroom on the Kiosk computer where    he scans its Work Order and the Inventory Card in the application Issue and Transfer of Maximo. When we rebuild something internally, the technician will bring the new assembly in store, grab the Inventory Card and he will report the return in store against the rebuilt Work order. Objectives: • Created a card stock report in order to match the existing Inventory Card tool developed by Systems. • Increase reporting of consumption • Redefine the process of cycle count (80% efficiency in Systems) • The report will be based on inventory information and will introduce the notion of real time to increase precision  BTRAMR0001SBB.rptdesign (Report Change): • The report BTRAMR0001SBB was developed for the European project. It is based on the BTRAMR0001MLM report and currently uses only launch option 2 and 3 of the BTRAMR0001MLM report.
